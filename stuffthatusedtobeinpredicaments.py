# stuffthatusedtobeinpredicaments.py
# generates the dictionary that holds all the available predicaments
# home to doIf() and getNonBlankLine()
# i moved all that back into predicaments.py.
# not having it there meant stuff couldn't raise BadPredicamentErrors
# i would like to separate it though...
