funtimes! a simple text-based adventure game.      

its only dependency is python3. it might work with 2.7, maybe.
you might be wondering about the reasoning behind some design decisions that were made. funtimes was originally a MS-DOS program written by a highschooler who apparently only knew how to use IF and GOTO. this version honours that legacy by... it doesn't really. i was just a little lazy with the porting. 

<@ninedotnine> this approach should make it easy to code the rest of the game
<@ninedotnine> there are some things i don't like about it though 
<@ninedotnine> like having a file that does nothing except list things that exist
<@ninedotnine> but if there's another way to do that, i'm currently overlooking it
<@ninedotnine> also, it loads the entire game into memory when you start playing
<@ninedotnine> that's not wonderful either
<@ninedotnine> but there are a few major upsides to this implementation 
<@ninedotnine> number one being at least it's not fucking dos

SUMMARY
--
FUNTIMES is a text-adventure game where you assume the role of a teenager living the longest day ever. During this day you'll have to do many tasks to gain weet points. These weet points are a representation of how "weet" you are -- weetness being the ultimate measure of one's awesomeness. You get weet points by doing weet things like finding a girlfriend, posting on forums, helping people out, etc. -- just be awesome and the game will do the rest of the work.

The game would be rated PG-13 if it went through the MPAA, for mild swearing, some sexuality, petty crime, and drug use. Don't play the game at all if any of these things offend you.

--
EXECUTION
--
Simply run "FUNTIMES.exe" to start playing the game. It will only run normally in Windows XP or higher, though it may be possible to get it running otherwise if you're dedicated enough. Running it in a zip file or whatever is not okay.
