funtimes! a simple text adventure game

its only dependency is python 3.3 (or higher). currently only works well on linux, but we're going to make it cross-platform later.

this is based on a batch-file game written by a high schooler. instead of doing things the simple way and writing it all in python, it's a game engine that interprets 'pred' files that use our own specialized syntax.

why? because why not. it's funtimes.

SUMMARY
--
FUNTIMES is a text-adventure game where you assume the role of a teenager living the longest day ever. During this day you'll have to do many tasks to gain weet points. These weet points are a representation of how "weet" you are -- weetness being the ultimate measure of one's awesomeness. You get weet points by doing weet things like finding a girlfriend, posting on forums, helping people out, etc. -- just be awesome and the game will do the rest of the work.

The game would be rated PG-13 if it went through the MPAA, for mild swearing, some sexuality, petty crime, and drug use. Don't play the game at all if any of these things offend you.

EXECUTION
--
Simply run "FUNTIMES.exe" to start playing the game. It will only run normally in Windows XP or higher, though it may be possible to get it running otherwise if you're dedicated enough. Running it in a zip file or whatever is not okay.
