               TO-DO:
-----------------------------------

improve sound support on linux?

if statements need better error messages

either make it so pred ifs can't access internal variables, or give a special
error for them so the user knows they used a reserved name. something.

maybe allow arbitrary dictionaries in if and set statements?

allow user to change settings (adjust clearOn, soundOn, fancyPrint, etc)

why does ^R not work after pausing...?

figure out how to get esc and arrow keys both working on linux
