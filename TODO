               TO-DO:
-----------------------------------

make PreventBarfing work on windows/not crash windows version

make anykey() work on windows

improve sound support on linux?

create some way to randomize variables (dice rolling)

if statements need better error messages

either make it so pred ifs can't access internal variables, or give a special
error for them so the user knows they used a reserved name. something.

make disable = pause

allow index in if and set statements (for items, quests)

make a way to set and unset quest and item booleans

make save system not use pickle and save into /data/

allow user to change settings (adjust clearOn, soundOn, fancyPrint, etc)

why does ^R not work after pausing...?

figure out how to get esc and arrow keys both working
