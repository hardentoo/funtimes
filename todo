make > and < function in if statements

make disable = pause

make disable = save

make disable = action (to make a room that does not require any action - can be used to set variables, or for a cutscene)

<tassaron> I'm going to make it so the first pred is actually something like "Welcome to FUNTIMES! blah blah blah. When you see the [-->] prompt, it means you can hit any button to continue" and then the next predicament after that cuts back to reveal you were actually playing an arcade game called Funtimes at the mall, which you and your friend decide is crap and then go to Pizza Pizza instead. Then it continues like it does now
